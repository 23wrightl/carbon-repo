                </i></p>
                <p>&emsp;We have all heard of ways to improve our carbon footprint: get an electric vehicle or solar panels for your house. Grow fruits and vegetables in a personal garden and make all your food at home instead of buying from stores. Frankly, these are expensive, time-consuming, and for some people, unrealistic.<br>&emsp;How is someone who can’t afford a gas-fueled car supposed to afford an electric vehicle? How is someone living in an apartment in New York City supposed to get solar panels on their roof? How are they supposed to grow vegetables and raise livestock?<br>&emsp;Well, sometimes small things can make a big difference! It may seem suspiciously easy, but something as simple as educating yourself, or doing community service, can help reduce your carbon footprint by a lot.

                <p>&emsp;If you are the more ambitious type, you can go the extra mile and work with your local government to create change. Even something as simple as voting for a clean energy bill goes a long way!</p>

                <p>&emsp;Researching into your country’s environmental and industrial ambitions can go a long way as well. Informing yourself is the most impactful action you can take today. Learn about the politics of environmentalism so you can bring the environment into politics. Help make your community and local government aware of our home.</p>

                <p>&emsp;Your singular vote can make an impact on your community. It may not immediately change the world or even your country, but you can always help your town or city.<br>&emsp;If your local authorities are not taking action, you can even contact your local representative and explain your concerns for our home and what you think we can do to help.</p>
                <div><b>Dieting: Not Just For Your Health</b></div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    &emsp;Trying to eat healthier is not only better for your body but better for the environment as well. Shopping local and organic is a big step in reducing our carbon emissions.
                </p>

                    <img class="article-right-img" src="/images/all-green-foods.jpeg" alt="Image displays a pile of all green fruits and vegetables." style="width:60%;">
                    <span class="article-right-text">&emsp;Everyone knows about dieting. It is typical for adults trying to lose weight, gain muscle, or be more healthy in general to go on a Keto or Mediterranean diet. Well, fun fact, diets do not only affect your health, they also affect the environment. When you eat less meat or just more organically it helps prevent medical disasters such as heart disease, cancer, and high blood pressure; they also assist us in averting environmental disasters such as pollution, excessive littering, and landfill seepage.</span>
                </div>  
                    
                <div>&emsp;The main issue with diets is how expensive, difficult to maintain, and time-consuming they can be. Lucky for us, there are a few common grocery stores that provide organic products for relatively low prices:</div>
                <div>
                    <img class="article-left-img" src="images/food-bins-store-img.png" alt="Image displays food bins on a store shelving stand. The foods include fruits and vegetables." style="width:60%;">

                </div>
                <br><br><br>
                <p>&emsp;Shopping at grocery stores not only helps support local farms and businesses but also helps limit waste. Organic foods can be turned into compost and put in gardens.<br>&emsp;Dieting is not just for taking care of your health; it is also a way of giving back to your environment.</p>

                <div>&esmp;Not working to help our environment is common because some feel their impact is too little to count. But, if we do nothing at all, we will watch as our home crumbles around us; let’s change that mindset!</div>

                <div>&emsp;Small things that have contributed to impactful differences in communities and even entire nations are recycling, using reusable containers, conserving water, and many more. &emsp;An example is Germany, where they have at least four different recycling bins in households. They also have large brown, white, and green glass containers nearby. Environmentalism is a crucial issue in Germany, so this is only one of their many steps to help the world.
                </div>

                    <img class="article-right-img" src="/images/german-trash-bins.png" alt="Image displays multiple recycling and waste containers. Each has a unique logo and color that requires different products to be placed inside." style="width:50%;display:block;">
                    <span class="article-right-text">&emsp;The bins are colored differently and named accordingly from right to left, Papier meaning paper, Kunststoff meaning plastic, Restmüll meaning residual waste or non-recyclable trash, Glas meaning glass, and Metall meaning metal. America is nowhere near this level of organization; however, we can all work individually and together to become more like Germany.</span>

                <div>
                    &emsp;Utilizing reusable containers and Tupperware is an easy change. It not only saves money in the long run but also contributes to saving the environment.&emsp;Switching from plastic water bottles and non-reusable coffee or tea cups to washable and reusable water bottles and coffee or tea cups is a great way to keep plastic out of landfills. Many places like Starbucks allow you to bring your reusable cups when buying coffee and other things (they no longer do this due to COVID-19). As mentioned before, many stores have organic foods for affordable prices. One of those grocery stores, Aldi, will charge people to use plastic bags to carry their groceries. They try to encourage customers to bring their own bags to reduce plastic waste. These are just a few of many instances where you can switch to using reusable containers.&emsp;There are also many methods and changes that people can implement in their daily lives to conserve water. Things like going vegetarian or not eating beef for one day a week can help save an immense amount of water. To make one pound of beef, producers must use around 1,500 to 2,000 gallons of water. If every individual decreased their meat consumption, the number of animals slaughtered during factory farming would reduce along with the water used for production. There are many vegetarian alternatives to red meat favorites due to chefs and culinary masters that share a passion for the environment.

                    <span class="article-left-text">&emsp;These are only a few of the immense changes you can make in your daily life that, when added up, can help save the world that we have slowly been killing.</span>
